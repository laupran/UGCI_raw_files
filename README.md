# UGCI_raw_files

These are the raw files used to produce Figures 1 to 4.
In particular, for Figure 2, sharing the raw file of the updated land-cover map is discouraged due to potential data sensitivity.
Please use these raw files only for reviewing the corresponding raw images.
A publicly shareable version of the land-cover map has been included in the “Calculating UGCI” directory together with the code.
